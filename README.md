## Hi there 👋
Welcome to my git-hub profile, I'm Miguel:
👨‍🔬 Bsc. in biology from University of Antioquia, Colombia 🇨🇴

# 👋 Hi, I'm Miguel Ángel Jiménez García

## 🌱 Biologist | Data Enthusiast | Science Communicator

I’m a biologist with a passion for fungi, biodiversity, and all things natural science. My work focuses on molecular biology, fungal cultivation, and environmental conservation, but my curiosity extends far beyond the lab. Whether it’s exploring ecosystems, analyzing data, or crafting fermented beverages, I love diving into the wonders of nature and sharing what I learn along the way.

What sets me apart is my interdisciplinary approach to solving problems. For example, in my [blog](https://vivircomoexperimento.blogspot.com/), I explore how thermodynamics and entropy can help us understand the value of work. This reflects my belief that science is not just about isolated facts but about connecting ideas to create meaningful insights.

If you’re curious about ecology, evolution, or the hidden world of fungi, you’re in the right place! I believe science should be accessible, engaging, and fun—just like my YouTube channel, **Mikeología Natural**.
